Hey y'all!

The Prism Space discord server is officially launching to the public!
https://discord.gg/UZdYGfNPmb

We're a community focal point for all folks under the rainbow!
We have no tolerance for intolerance and we encourage folks to Check-In/Check-Out as they need.

Please note: we are still looking for people to join the Mod Squad.
If you'd like to apply for the Mod Squad, please fill out this form:

We had a short beta phase to work out some of the issues, but please let us know if you have any feedback. We're always looking to improve the Space!
